#### This game is called “Jim Goes to the Supermarket”. You play as the titular family man Jim, and he needs to rush to the store to buy a cake because it is his daughter Callie’s birthday. He tried cooking a cake himself, but let’s just say it did not go so well. 
#### The game consists of a branching narrative structure that presents the player with a variety of scenarios that they can choose to eventually acquire the cake, which is the main goal of the game.
