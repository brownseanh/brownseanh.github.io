##### This game is called “Jim Goes to the Supermarket”. You play as the titular family man Jim, and he needs to rush to the store to buy a cake because it is his daughter Callie’s birthday. He tried cooking a cake himself, but let’s just say it did not go so well. 
##### The game consists of a branching narrative structure that presents the player with a variety of scenarios that they can choose to eventually acquire the cake, which is the main goal of the game.

### YTFiguringOutClasses
##### I was having trouble early on in Programming 101, so I found some YouTube tutorials to help me, and this was one of the projets I made while following along with those videos to help me wrap my brain around the concept of classes.

### YTtutorialYourFirstProject
##### This was the first program I made while following along with the videos discussed above in YTFiguringOutClasses. It was to get me comfortable with different variable types, constants, and the basic workings of Visual Studio.
